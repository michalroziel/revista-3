Seemingly disparate personalities upon conception. However, once the initial fogginess has cleared up, we came towards a point of relation that both of us marveled at. Not because it was exuberant in nature but because of the realisation that dawned upon us - how diminutive the scale of the world we live in is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing each other again, after all that time, and talking about the things we have been through and accomplished, in many ways seems surreal even as I took these photos of him, and as I write this. It goes to show how the smallest of reasons could be the basis of connection, of which, held strong over an extended period of time, which could be probably be a matter of expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

But the fragility of it also tends to be something that defines it, or rather, is characteristic of it. Etched with periods of quietness, and momentary spikes of stimulating conversations etch the landscape of amicability. The etches marked different epochs within the span of our friendship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is not to say I speak of us in a negative light but one of admiration and respect. She has helped me grow as a person. Perhaps we do not correspond or relate with each other at a level that I had expected or desired but that very same tenuous link represents the fragility of relationships as a whole, and of how we, or rather I take them for granted.&lt;/p&gt;

Also serendipitously met. Varied, raw individual, with a youthful splendor. Despite having only met for a few moments, she was keen on getting her portraits taken. The ease of the whole process has got me thinking about the irrationality behind the fear of the unknown. But you can never really know till you have taken the plunge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A comrade in the arts, and an idealistic thinker. A character of strength and resilience, with sheer lack of concern for how people thought of her, is something to be admired and is something that is sorely lacking in a society whereby there a predominance of the concept of “the image”, and the conscious need to fit within the social constraints of the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went about documenting a day in the life of their family. It was a surreal experience, and oftentimes got me thinking about how distant it can be when taking photos, being a part of the ebb and flow of their day, even if just a day, proved to be something I would think about for some time.&lt;/p&gt;
