&lt;p&gt;It has been a long time coming, I have long wanted to create a site just for this. Lo and behold, here it is. There has been a lot of tinkering, and it is a work in progress so you&apos;ll see a lot of changes from now on. But generally, this is how it should look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More photos would be uploaded eventually once I get my hands on a dedicated film scanner. Till then, enjoy what is there right now.&lt;/p&gt;

I&apos;m writing again. I think there&apos;s cause for celebration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I was in the darkroom for the first time. For someone who has shot on film for 6 years, and never being in the darkroom, is a bit of a shame. Regardless, I will strive to develop my own film, at the very least, the black and whites ones my own. Of course, I&apos;m scanning them by myself as well. Speaking of which, the film scanner is called Reflecta RPS 10M, expensive as hell and it&apos;s on its way here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to god nothing screws up. That&apos;ll be a $900 screw up if it does. Plus shipping.&lt;/p&gt;

That is in the technical sense. But there&apos;s also the aesthetic quality that we have to talk about, or rather I do. I am not quite satisfied with it. I don&apos;t quite know what to do with the existing images that I do have besides editing them the best I can and uploading them here. Of course, Instagram hides the flaws more but I suppose the whole point of having this site is to be honest about everything.</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2017 13:28:26 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As I have said before the lack of dedicate film scanner means that the quality of the photos are sub-par.
